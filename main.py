#Steps
#1) download an album as a folder
        #buy on qobuz
#2) how to to open a folder and digest x amount of files in it
        #use os.listdir() to get a list of files in a folder
#3) process each song as data
        #use librosa to get the data of a song or whatever
        #figure whats the difference between each song
#4) what does data of a song look like (sounds, producers, lyrics, etc)
        #access some api to get the metadata of a song (producers, songwriters, lyrics, and order of songs so song 1 to song 2's relation)
#5) create some kind of proccessing algorithm to digest the frequencies and patterns of the different songs
#6) output some metric of how homogenous the album is
#7) maybe have a visual representation of the album
#    could be a word cloud, spotify wrap style visual, a web linking each song with % similarity between each song

# create a class for songs
