(Lord)\nMama, you was the life of the party\nI swear you brought life to the party\nWhen you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)\nThat woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)\nVisions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me\nMovin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army\n'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)\nYou want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)\n'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here\nBeen in the dark so long, don't know if the light here\nBut I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)\nAnd now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)\nI deaded those night terrors when the night clears\nAnd if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?\nAnd if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)\nBut back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)\nYou better have a strategy or you could be a statistic\nLittle boy dies, he's just one of the mystic\nAnd mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)\nAnd she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)\nAnd her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid\nThat's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it\nSixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)\nBut we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)\nBaby shower time, father didn't show up\nNow she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up\nThe water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)\nA year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)\nAnd she's still dependent on her mom\nBig brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun\nHe want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)\nAnd her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)\nIs it real love? Do the scars really heal up?\nFrom all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)\nA week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)\nLeft his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side\nHe seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes\nTo see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)\nEven let him get the last meal\nHe done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)\nHe gotta show him that it's that real\nHe ran up on him with the pipe like, \"****, stand still\" (Jesus)\n\"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry\" (Lord)\n\"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ\"\nHe said, \"Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ\"\nThen big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]\nUh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)\nThank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertu\u011frul (Jesus)\nEvery knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)\nTo the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)\nIt's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor\nBack from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)\nI never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)\nBut I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda\nEarthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)\nWhat the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)\nIn Tepoztl\u00e1n, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)\nI shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal\nThe God is interstellar while you fellas remain local\nMy bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)\nAs sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)\nI could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel\nMy sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne\nBut when you great, they wanna say you took a L, Jos\u00e9 Castillo (Jesus)\nI'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)\nMy rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears\nThirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier\nIt's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)\nIt's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kanye West]\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nNow we've been through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nHe lives in a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nBeen through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\n\n[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]\nWhat up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr\nFirst and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office\nYou might not have been the only one that could've did that\nBut you were the one that did do that\nAnd with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight\nYou know, to me, it kinda feels like\nMe, my mother, my brothers, and my kids\nHave all been incarcerated through this journey\nAnd we haven't even been to jail\nWe have been looked at and treated as criminals\nFor being a part of this family\nMy father's truth and the reality that he raised me in\nIs that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)\n'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him\nAnd it is what made the children of today\nAfter twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one\nMy father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world\nAnd will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples\nIf my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction\nInto the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years\nMan, he would be dead to me\nI didn't sign up for that\nI didn't stay on this journey this long for that\nAll my life, man\nI've been waitin' for my father to come home\nThey told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home\nThen they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home\nI went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home\nNow I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated\nHe still not home\nNow even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'\nMatter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren\nAnd they haven't been able to touch they grandfather\nEven though it is not seen that way for some of us\nBut for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community\nWho deserves to breathe free air\nFree my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)63Embed"

This Larry Hoover Jr\nFirst and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office\nYou might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that\nAnd with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight\nYou know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail\nWe have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family\nMy father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)\nBecause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today\nAfter twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world\nAnd will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples\nIf my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years\nMan, he would be dead to me\nI didn't sign up for that\nI didn't stay on this journey this long for that\nAll my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home\nThey told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home\nThen they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home\nI went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home\nNow I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated\nHe still not home\nNow even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'\nMatter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren\nAnd they haven't been able to touch they grandfather\nEven though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air\nFree my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)27Embed"
